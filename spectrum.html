						<h2><u>Problem & Solution</u></h2>
						<p>A customized call center web application needed to be designed and developed for the Resource Center staff to better serve  callers as well as provide management and leadership an opportunity to analyze data and improve operational performance.</p>
						<p>
							Support unique call center workflows.
							Collection and capture data for strategic planning and resource management.
							Deliver a single solution for use on desktop or tablet devices.

				<h1>My responsibilities included user research, interface design, interaction design, prototype and mockups creation, user testing and design system documentation.</h1>
				</div>

				<div id="container">
				<h2><u>Process and Methods</u></h2>
				<p>I worked closely with the Project Manager in planning and executing a design process that aligned effectively with the clients needs as well as the development team’s 
					approach (primarily waterfall). As this was a newly imagined solution, both the client and the development team benefited from the iterative design/test phase with low-fidelity prototypes.</p>
				<p>Research: Contextual inquiries users interviews stakeholder interviews.</p>
				<p>Concept & Design Generation: Design workshops paper prototypes workflows.</p>
				<p>Low-Fidelity Prototype: Wireframes & Prototype.</p>
				<p>Testing: Moderated Usability Testing</p>
				<p>High-Fidelity Mockups: Moderated Usability Testing</p>
				<p>Style Guide: Moderated Usability Testing</p>

					<h2><u>User and Stakeholder Interviews</u>
					</h2>
					<p>I planned and conducted interviews with Resource Center staff and management at the start of the project. These stakeholder interviews yielded valuable information about the current pain points and struggle the team was experiencing. I conducted contextual inquiries with the customer service representatives (CSRs).  This provided a “boots on the ground” perspective of call volume, application usage, and individual workarounds.</p>
						<p>Most workflows involved a “start-and-stop” process; where initial caller information was collected and recorded and would be “picked up” later when there was time to locate requested information.</p>
						<p>Each Call Center staff member recorded call information on individual notebooks (shown), with no data being collected on the nature of the call.</p>
				<br>
				</div>
				<div id="container">

				<h2><u>Design Workshops, Concept Models and User Story Maps	</u></h2>
<p>With a better understanding of the Resource Center’s goals, needs, pain points, and current processes, I planned and facilitated design workshops with the team. These sessions helped work through concept models, user stories ultimately leading us to explore various solutions. Through “how could we” exercises, we ultimately agreed on a concept model that combined a ticketing system with a “pinning” system of resources that could be sent directly to the caller, collecting valuable data points along the way.
</div>
</p>
<div id="container">

<h2><u>Use Cases and Workflows</u></h2>
<p>I  documented the application’s use cases and workflows. This provided value to the project at multiple levels:

	Acted as a guide in designing the user interface.
	Gave clarity to the backend developer / architect as they began to plan the technical aspects of the application.
	Provided a framework that helped in the testing phase of the project; focusing our attention on the most critical tasks that delivered the most value to the Resource Center staff.
	
</p>
</div>

<div id="container">

<h2><u>Sketches, Wireframes and Prototypes</u></h2>
<p>I typically prefer sketching interface and interaction designs as it allows for greater exploration and generation of more ideas without being concerned with smaller details such as colors, fonts, and precise alignment.

	I have also found that sketching also improves communication when early designs are being shared with the team. It has everyone focus on the important issues at this early stage, such as the overall structure and flow of the interaction, while not being distracted by the details of the look.
	
	Following review of sketches, I move to using Axure to construct wireframes with interactions and prepared for user testing.</p>

	<center><h2><u>High-Fidelity Mockups
	</u></h2>
			<p> With input from the testing sessions I moved to create high-fidelity mockups using Figma and sketch. This effort included creating visual mockups of the final design for both tablet and desktop displays.
			</p></center>

<div id="container">
				<center><h2><u>Learning Process</u></h2>
						<p> With the final interface design completed, an inventory of all interface elements and components were identified and documented in a style guide to be used as a front-end development reference. Project was on going process. Through out this process learned important element from each employee or manager, if it’s as researcher or developer.
                            learning process was on going with different dashboard, features and design. Used Adobe XD and figma to show case prototype for most of the users. 
                            Every user is different and that was definitely biggest lesson. To see users vision thru their eyes and design it to make it easier for them.

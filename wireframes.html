						<h2><u>Problem & Solution</u></h2>
						<p>Collabrating between teams, task and managers was defficalt before Inhouse App. App started out to just keep track of tickets and data.
							but then I realized communication was not the only problem, for UI team to contact database team for every API pull to clinets and eployees information. 
							So due to this we'll have to create login for each user. Users and teams will get access to only dashboreds they have been approved. but before that lets look at example of user </p>
				</div>
				<div id="container">

				<h2><u>Understand the Users</u></h2>
				<p>I researched by asking employees and managers who will be using this app. Also asked them to make list of things they wanna deract to in App.
					each managers had diffrent request and requerments for there teams. </p>
					<p> The process below begins with my initial ideas wireframes, then moves to mockups, and finally to the high-fidelity prototype. In this simple version, you can see how the I approach solving the users needs. 
						There are customizable elements that users can drag and edit. There are preview areas where the user can directly see their design. 
						 Obviously this process was on going udates for Managers and teams. From Wireframes to Prototype, bringing idea to an interactive digital low-fidelity prototype and collect feedbacks from users.</p>

			<p> Review and feedback is last brush up before starting to developing. For this particular App, mokups and feedbacks is on going process.
                Reached out to each users for research and demo for in process development. each client had different vision and requirements so constant feedback is necessary.

<div id="container">
				<center><h2><u>Learning Process</u></h2></center>
						<p> Project was on going process. Through out this process learned important element from each employee or manager, if itâ€™s as researcher or developer.
                            learning process was on going with different dashboard, features and design. Used Adobe XD and figma to show case prototype for most of the users. 
                            Every user is different and that was definitely biggest lesson. To see users vision thru their eyes and design it to make it easier for them.

						<h2>Problem & Solution</h2>
						<p>Collabrating between teams, task and managers was defficalt before Inhouse App. App started out to just keep track of tickets and data.
							but then I realized communication was not the only problem, for UI team to contact database team for every API pull to clinets and eployees information. 
							So due to this we'll have to create login for each user. Users and teams will get access to only dashboreds they have been approved. but before that lets look at example of user </p>
				
				<h2>Understand the Users</h2>
				<p>I researched by asking employees and managers who will be using this app. Also asked them to make list of things they wanna deract to in App.
					each managers had diffrent request and requerments for there teams.  </p>

					<h2>Mr. Nehs team</h2>

	<p> The process above begins with my initial ideas wireframes, then moves to mockups, and finally to the high-fidelity prototype. In this simple version, you can see how the I approach solving the users needs. 
		There are customizable elements that users can drag and edit. There are preview areas where the user can directly see their design. 
		There is also a clear add to cart action button. Obviously this process was on going udates for Managers and teams.</p>

			<p>I then brought my idea to an interactive digital low-fidelity prototype and brought it to five potential users to collect feedbacks.
